# Affinity

Affinty.works is supporting the surge of resistance against Trump. It's coming at it in two ways. First, working with the new activist groups that have sprung up, building MVP's to solve the problems they've encountered in their organizing. Second, Affinity is enabling rapid collaboration between the grassroots and the big national networks like Indivisible & Daily Kos, to defend the institutions of democracy.

Concretely, the tool is a SaaS and has components for managing a network of groups, a crm, task management for volunteers, outreach, and a reputation marketplace between campaigns, activists, and groups.

# Status:
